        "- A . Key Differences:\n",
        "- Definition and Scope:\n",
        "- Function: Defined using the def keyword, a function can exist independently and is not tied to any specific object. It is called directly.\n",
        "- Method: A method is also defined using def, but it is associated with an object and typically operates on that object’s data. It is called on the object.\n",

        "- C . Association:\n",
        "- Function: Independent of any class or object.\n",
        "- Method: Belongs to a class and usually requires an instance of that class (or the class itself for class methods) to be called.\n",

        "10 .  What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "- 1. map() Function:\n",
        "- Purpose: Applies a function to each item in an iterable (or multiple iterables) and returns a new iterable (map object) with the results.\n",
        "- Output: A new iterable where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding item of the input iterable(s).\n",
        "- Usage: Use map() when you need to transform or modify every item in an iterable.\n",
        "- 2. reduce() Function:\n",
        "- Purpose: Applies a binary function (a function with two arguments) cumulatively to the items in an iterable. It processes the iterable from left to right, reducing it to a single value.\n",
        "- Output: A single value that is the result of applying the function cumulatively to the iterable’s items.\n",
        "- Usage: Use reduce() when you want to combine or accumulate items into a single result (like summing a list, multiplying values, etc.).\n",
        "- 3. filter() Function:\n",
        "- Purpose: Applies a function that returns a boolean value to each item in an iterable. It filters out elements for which the function returns False and returns a new iterable with only the elements for which the function returned - - True.\n",
        "- Output: A new iterable containing only the items that satisfy the condition (i.e., where the function returns True).\n",
        "Usage: Use filter() when you want to select certain items from an iterable based on a condition.\n",
